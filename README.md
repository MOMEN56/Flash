Hello guys!
Today, I'm excited to release my App

 App name: Flash | ŸÅŸÑÿßÿ¥
‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ The app supports both Arabic and English languages
‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Its design is responsive and works efficiently on all screen sizes

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Part One: Currency Rates
The app displays different currency rates based on a comparison currency selected by the user.
The selected currency is saved in the device's memory, so when the user reopens the app, the same currency is still selected and the rates are shown accordingly.

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Second Screen: Currency Converter
The user can enter a specific amount and choose the currency to convert from, as well as the currency to convert to,
and the app immediately calculates and displays the result accurately and quickly.

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Part Two: Crypto‚Çø
The app displays the prices of the most popular cryptocurrencies against the US Dollar ($).
When the user taps on any crypto, the app navigates to a special screen that includes:

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ üí∞ The market value of the crypto
‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ üìà The price change rate during the last 24 hours
‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ ‚ÑπÔ∏è More detailed information about the crypto

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Part Three: Metal Prices
The app shows the prices of the most well-known metals in US dollars,
with the ability for the user to choose between the following weight units:

‚öñÔ∏è Gram ‚Äì Ounce ‚Äì Kilogram ‚Äì Ton

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Why did I use two packages to manage internet connectivity?
I explained the idea in detail in this video:
